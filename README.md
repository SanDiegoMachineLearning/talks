## 2020

**A RapidMiner Overview** by Steven Fouskarinis
<br>
*November 14, 2020*
* RapidMiner is a platform that is used by over 4,000 universities to teach machine learning concepts to students while not presuming those students can program. However, the platform is also used by over 40,000 organizations worldwide for commercial applications. Come and take a brief but informative guided tour of the RapidMiner coal mines from a user not a salesperson.
* Steven Fouskarinis is an electrical engineer and computer scientist by training who works on scaling execution at a company level. Past projects include using NLP to infer ICDs & CPTs from clinical notes, automating medical bill creation and submission, predicting infusion pump misuse, and using a chatbot as a non-visual interface for research paper discovery.
* [Slides](./SDML-RapidMiner_Overview.pdf) and the video will be uploaded soon

## 2019

**Genetics & Genomics** by Chris Keown
<br>
*June 20, 2019*
* Most people have a superficial understanding of genetics, as it plays a causal role in who we are. In the first half of this talk, I will explain what the field of genetics is, how we do experiments and analyses, and the recent learnings and challenges in the field. In the second half of my talk, I will focus on genomics and epigenomics. These are two very hot areas in research, but are lesser known to non-experts. Again, I will explain the field, how we do experiments and analyses, and how machine learning has been and can be applied in this domain.

**Productizing ML** by Ryan Chesler
<br>
*June 13, 2019*
* A discussion how to make a product out of a machine learning idea. 
Walking briefly through all of the things that need to be considered while building a machine learning project, beyond just building models.
* Ryan is an organizer of the San Diego Machine Learning meetup and a Data Scientist working for H2O.ai developing automated machine learning systems. He is a Kaggle triple master and has taken several systems to production all the way from idea to deployment.

**Intro to Text Summarization and Topic Segmentation** by Vibhu Sapra
<br>
*June 13, 2019*
* An introduction to text summarization and to different approaches towards topic segmentation. 
The talk will cover the basics of how machine summarization works, applications of text summarization, code examples, and explore current state of the art models.
* Vibhu is the founder of Byrd.ai and has been developing various NLP models for text summarization in a production setting.
