### 2021

**Rainforest Connection Species Audio Detection - A Kaggle Competition Recap** by Ryan Chesler
<br>
*March 13, 2021*
* Come hear about the Rainforest Connection Species Audio Detection competition on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/rfcx-species-audio-detection). This free, virtual meetup will discuss the recently completed competition.
* From Kaggle:
In this competition, you’ll automate the detection of bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings. You'll create your models with limited, acoustically complex training data. Rich in more than bird and frog noises, expect to hear an insect or two, which your model will need to filter out.
* Ryan is an organizer of the San Diego Machine Learning meetup and a Data Scientist working for H2O.ai developing automated machine learning systems. He is a Kaggle grand master and self-driving car enthusiast.

### 2020

**Investment Analytics in the Dawn of Artificial Intelligence** by Bernard Lee \
*December 12, 2020*
* This talk attempts to answer a few questions:
  1) Why artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) is helpful to certain fintech apps?
  2) When AI/ML works well in fintech? When it may not work so well?
  3) Apart from interesting theories, what are the practical prerequisites for AI/ML applications to perform well in real-life finance, to the point of replacing jobs?
  4) Where society may end up if trusted AI/ML applications in fintech become widely available?
  5) What may be the potential implications for me, my financial future, and my career?
* Bernard Lee is the founder/CEO of HedgeSPA, whose mission is to revolutionize the landscape of professional investment analytics by democratizing access to the most sophisticated B2B investment analytics tool. HedgeSPA's core investment platform is unique in its utilization of Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and High-Performance/Quantum Computing.

**Neuroscience in the data science age** by Bradley Voytek \
*December 8, 2020*
* The brain is often likened to a symphony, where 86 billion neurons are coordinating in an unfathomably complex electrochemical orchestra. However, our brains are more like a symphony without a conductor: there is no leader orchestrating those 86 billion neurons! Despite this apparent chaos, our brains usually just work (if we're lucky!). My research lab leverages a data science approach to neuroscience in order to understand how these 86 billion neurons communicate with one another, and to figure out when, why, and how that process breaks down.
* Bradley Voytek is an Associate Professor in the Department of Cognitive Science, the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute, and the Neurosciences Graduate Program at UC San Diego. He is both an Alfred P. Sloan Neuroscience Research Fellow and a Kavli Fellow of the National Academies of Sciences, as well as a founding faculty member of the UC San Diego Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute and the Undergraduate Data Science program, where he serves as Vice-Chair.

**Lyft Motion Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles - A Kaggle Competition Recap** by Ryan Chesler
<br>
*November 28, 2020*
* Come hear about the Lyft Motion Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles competition on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/lyft-motion-prediction-autonomous-vehicles). This virtual meetup is scheduled just days after the competition closes.
* From Kaggle:
In this competition, you’ll apply your data science skills to build motion prediction models for self-driving vehicles. You'll have access to the largest Prediction Dataset ever released to train and test your models. Your knowledge of machine learning will then be required to predict how cars, cyclists, and pedestrians move in the AV's environment.
* Ryan is an organizer of the San Diego Machine Learning meetup and a Data Scientist working for H2O.ai developing automated machine learning systems. He is a Kaggle triple master and self-driving car enthusiast.

**A RapidMiner Overview** by Steven Fouskarinis
<br>
*November 14, 2020*
* RapidMiner is a platform that is used by over 4,000 universities to teach machine learning concepts to students while not presuming those students can program. However, the platform is also used by over 40,000 organizations worldwide for commercial applications. Come and take a brief but informative guided tour of the RapidMiner coal mines from a user not a salesperson.
* Steven Fouskarinis is an electrical engineer and computer scientist by training who works on scaling execution at a company level. Past projects include using NLP to infer ICDs & CPTs from clinical notes, automating medical bill creation and submission, predicting infusion pump misuse, and using a chatbot as a non-visual interface for research paper discovery.

**Genetics & Genomics** by Chris Keown
<br>
*June 20, 2020*
* Most people have a superficial understanding of genetics, as it plays a causal role in who we are. In the first half of this talk, I will explain what the field of genetics is, how we do experiments and analyses, and the recent learnings and challenges in the field. In the second half of my talk, I will focus on genomics and epigenomics. These are two very hot areas in research, but are lesser known to non-experts. Again, I will explain the field, how we do experiments and analyses, and how machine learning has been and can be applied in this domain.
